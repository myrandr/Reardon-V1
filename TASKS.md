# Reardon Builders - Task List

## Priority Tasks
1.  Set home page images to the sme dimension as the images on the gallery page.
2.  Scale down the homepage stats section for mobile/tablet responsive views. Currently shows "500+ Projects Completed" and "40+ Years Experience" with icons. Reduce icon sizes, number font sizes, and label text proportionally for screens under 768px. Also tighten vertical padding to give it less real estate on smaller screens—it's eating up too much space in mobile view.
3. Reduce hero section height for mobile responsive design on reardonbuilders.com homepage. Currently there's excessive vertical spacing—too much blue background between the header and hero text, and between hero text and stats section below.
-Requirements:
	-Decrease hero section min-height for mobile/tablet viewports (under 768px)
	Tighten vertical padding around the hero text content while keeping it visually centered
	Maintain the aspect ratio and focal point of the background image—don't crop out the house
	Keep the text hierarchy readable (headline, tagline, subtext, CTAs)
	Goal: compress vertical space without making content feel cramped

The desktop version can stay as-is—only adjust for responsive breakpoints.
Test on iPhone portrait (375-430px width) and iPad portrait (768px).
