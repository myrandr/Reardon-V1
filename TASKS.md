# Reardon Builders - Task List

## Priority Tasks
Fix responsive hero section on homepage for landscape mobile/tablet views
Current issue: On reardonbuilders.com homepage, the hero section breaks in landscape orientation on iPhone and iPad. The navigation menu overlaps the headline text "Building Excellence," and vertical spacing is too compressed.
Requirements:

Adjust hero section min-height to prevent text overlap with fixed navigation
Reduce font sizes and spacing proportionally for landscape orientations (aspect-ratio media query)
Ensure logo, nav menu, headline, tagline, and subtext all have proper vertical clearance
Test specifically for landscape iPad (1024x768) and landscape iPhone (844x390 typical)

The portrait orientation works fine—only landscape is broken. Other pages don't have this issue.
